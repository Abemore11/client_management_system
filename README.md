# Overview

As a software engineer, I wanted to familiarize myself with the Java development environment, including the JDK, the IntelliJ Idea IDE, and of course the Java language itself. I used this project to explore object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, encapsulation, and modular design while building a functional and relevant application.

This project is a **Client Management System** written entirely in Java and designed to run in a command-line interface. It allows users to add, update, view, and remove client records in a simple and organized way. This application demonstrates key programming concepts, including variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and the use of a data structure from the Java Collection Framework (ArrayList).

My purpose for developing this console application was to gain hands-on experience designing software that is scalable and maintainable using the Java language.
